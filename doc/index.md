# BaconPdf

[BaconPdf](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconPdf) is a powerful yet simple PDF library written in PHP. It aims to support
the full PDF 1.7 standard. This documentation aims to guide you through the usage of the library. If you encounter
issues in the documentation or think that some topic needs more explanations, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconPdf/issues) on GitHub.

In cases where the documentation refers to chapters of the PDF specification, those are always for version 1.7. You can
find a PDF for the reference guide here:
